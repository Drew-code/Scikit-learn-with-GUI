# Scikit-learn-with-GUI
Easy to use interface for basic scikit-learn functions

## Introduction  
This project contains files for both front and back end python files for use with scikit-learn.  This is meant  
for anyone who wants to get into machine learning with python but does not know where to start. Hopefully by disecting  
this project you are able to understand the basic template of how machine learning and more specifically supervised learning 
works. This has applications for situations where pervious data is collected and is leveraged to predict what might occur 
in future cases with similar data. This GUI only supports the use of the Train/Test split method of supervised learning, but  contains 5 algorithms for different use cases.


## Technologies Used  
- Python 3.6  
- Scikit learn module for Python 3.6 (documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ )  
- WxPython module for Python 3.6 (documentation: https://wxpython.org/ )  
- Pandas module for Python 3.6 (documentaion: https://pandas.pydata.org/ )
